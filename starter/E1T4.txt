Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

1. Lack of Encryption for Data in Transit
Description: The architecture diagram or application steps do not mention the use of HTTPS or other encryption protocols for securing data in transit between clients and the web service.
Justification: Without encryption, sensitive data can be intercepted during transmission, exposing it to potential attackers. Implementing HTTPS ensures data integrity and confidentiality by encrypting the data.
2. Publicly Accessible S3 Buckets
Description: The architecture shows that the S3 bucket containing sensitive data is publicly accessible without appropriate access controls.
Justification: Publicly accessible S3 buckets can lead to data breaches. Sensitive data should be protected with proper bucket policies, restricting access only to authorized users or services. This minimizes the risk of data exposure or misuse.
