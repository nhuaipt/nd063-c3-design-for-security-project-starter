1. **Preventing SSH Brute Force Attacks**:
   - **Limit SSH Access**: Restrict SSH access to trusted IP addresses using Security Group rules. This minimizes the risk of brute force attempts from unknown sources.
   - **Enable MFA for SSH**: Use tools that require multi-factor authentication for SSH logins, adding an additional layer of security beyond just a password or key.
   - **Use Bastion Host**: Deploy a bastion host within a private subnet, allowing SSH access only through this host. This isolates direct SSH access to critical servers.

2. **Preventing Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data in S3**:
   - **Implement Least Privilege IAM Roles**: Assign roles to instances with the minimum permissions necessary, reducing the risk of unauthorized S3 access.
   - **Conditional S3 Bucket Policies**: Use bucket policies that restrict access based on specific conditions, such as source VPC or IP, ensuring that only authorized resources can access sensitive data.
   - **S3 Encryption**: Enforce server-side encryption (SSE) with AWS KMS, ensuring that sensitive data is encrypted at rest and accessible only by those with appropriate permissions.
